# PI - Image!

This is a simple, single endpointed, REST API to generate Blazingly Fast images to be consumed by the application [Olavo Tem Raz√£o](https://olavo-tem-razao.vercel.app/).

Maybe, in the future, I will tweak it to be more general pourpose oriented.
If you want to, feel free to fork it or clone it.

It is currently deployed at http://lindennerd1.pythonanywhere.com/.

## Installing locally
